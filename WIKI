For this project I had to select a chip and interface with it depending on what online resources I was able to find for the component. 
I was able to find general datasheets for various USB chips so I interfaced by utilizing the USB chip in a low voltage Arduino circuit.

I initially purchased and presented on the USB chip cp2102 2.0, this ended up being a difficult product to use as the drivers 
available were't compatible with my device. I later purchased and successfully used a USB chip SHU09C.

After installing the chip I originally used it with a LED Arduino circuit but later tried it with an LCD circuit, this ended up being the
same circuit as our LCD peripheral lab. The circuit itself is the same excluding the USB chip. Below is two schematics, first is the
supplied circuit schematic for the LCD circuit given to us for our lab. Second is a drawn schematic for the USB.

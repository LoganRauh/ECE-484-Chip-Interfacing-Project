# ECE-484-Chip-Interfacing-Project

* Project 1 Chip Interfacing - USB chip
* ECE484 Embedded Systems Desgin
* Logan Rauh

Description:
The goal of this project was to select a chip or electrical component from a list. Then based on the amount of resources online for interfacing with that component we were to add to what was avaialble. I chose the USB chip, a data transmission device. I was able to find datasheets online for pin assignments and general information. So my goal was to use this chip with an Arduino micro-controller and C programs compilable with avr-gcc.
